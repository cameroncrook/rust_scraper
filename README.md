# Overview

Attempting to expound my knowledge of different web scraping technolgies. Utilizing Rust in this project to compare to Python Beautiful Soup.

A simple Rust script that scrapes a [fake job listings](https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/) website designed to help developers test their scraping skills. This program collects relevent job data, puts it into a data structure and then will evaluate the data and display select data back to the terminal.

This script does not have any major real life implications. Was created to test Rust as a scraping option.
